# Avoid-the-Goals
A basic game in which your goal is to reach a finish line at the end of a course filled with goalposts which you must avoid, while collecting as many coins as possible.

## Resources
The scripts have been uploaded which control the ball's movements, the camera moves behind the ball, and the coins you collect are counted and displayed at your play's end. You lose if you touch the inside of any goal (the outside is fine) and you win by reaching the finish line at the end of the level.
